BUBBLES:
- IfBub : A visual conditional that can be used instead of the in-bubble 'if' function.  Aside from its visual representation, it also has the advantage of only evalutating the appropriate resultant.  This makes the IfBub very useful in creating recursive functions without needing to use the Function data type.

- TailBub : A new type of a MechBub specifically designed for creating recursive functions, greatly simplifing the ability to create loops.  The TailBub's visual structure guides the user in creating a tail call optimized recursion which has performance advantages over MechBub recursion, but more importantly eliminates the 500 loop limit of the MechBub.  (The TailBub will process for up to 1 second, which allow for signficantly more iterations)

- CronBub : Allows for the creation of a timer that increments its value periodically based on input parameters.  The utility of the CronBub, is perhaps a bit limited at this point, but it will become an essential tool for modeling and animating with the arrival of the 2nd aspect of Oovium.

- TypeBub : Allows for the mapping of entities and relationships.  Currently, the TypeBub is not integrated with the other bubble types of Oovium and is a faint shadow of it's ultimate functionality.  However, it has been slipped into this version both as a preview of future attractions and because even in it's current form, it can be useful in creating some simple diagrams.

FUNCTIONS:
- [!,&,|] - the 'not' !, 'and' & and 'or' | operators have been added to the Lexicon

OTHER:
- The resolution of exported images has been increased to match the retina display.  There are still plans to create a vector output, but that hasn't been done yet.

- In conjunction with the conversion of Oovium to OS X, once again massive under-the-cover refactoring has occurred with this version, including the conversion to the ARC memory model, a revamp of the Hover mechanism, some tweaks to the Math engine and major restructing of the Bubble system to allow for easier creation of new Bubbles, although more work is still needed with that.";

"ooviumText" = "Welcome to Oovium

What if a person ignorant of all past calculation tools were to design from scratch an app for doing calculations that made full use of the technology and concepts available to us today?  What would that application look like?

Over the years Aepryus has had numerous ideas for applications.  Eventually, it was realized that six of these ideas were just six different aspects of the same program.  Oovium is that program.

Or rather, Oovium will become that program.  Oovium is a mathematical sandbox.  As of version 1.1, Oovium includes one of the six aspects; code named Bricklin; this aspect is the implementation of an object oriented spreadsheet.  Eventually, the other 5 aspects will be incorporated into Oovium, code named Crawford, Shazaam, Archimedes, Eddington and Mithrandir.";

"ooviumMmText" = "Oovium Mind Mapper

Designed to replace your white board; it allows you to place nodes on a field (the aether) and designate links between them. Each node can have multiple inputs and outputs (a directed graph).

Particular attention was given to creating a natural and elegant gesture suite that allows for quick and easy manipulations of the bubbles upon the aether.

Be sure to read up on Anchoring to learn about these gestures.";

"anchoringText" = "The Joy of Anchoring

The workspace of Oovium is an arbitrarily large 2 dimensional plane that allows users to place bubbles upon it.  This plane is referred to as the Aether.  As Bubbles are added to the Aether, it automatically resizes to accommodate all of the bubbles.  In using Oovium, there is an important class of gestures known as anchoring.

Anchoring is holding the Aether still with one finger while performing another action with a different finger.  These gestures are:

MOVE BUBBLE [Anchor+Drag:bubble]
Anchor with one finger, then drag a bubble with another.  The more fingers that you use, the more bubbles you can drag around.

CONTEXT MENU [Anchor+Tap:bubble]
Anchor with one finger and tap a bubble with another.  This will bring up a context menu for the bubble that will allow you to perform additional actions to the bubble, such as Label and Delete.

LASSO [Anchor+Drag:aether]
Anchor with one finger and drag another finger on empty space.  A yellow path will begin to render along the path of your second finger.  You will be able to select multiple Bubbles and then move them as a group or perform relevant context menu actions on all of them.

MOVE CURSOR [Anchor+Tap:expression]
While editing an expression, anchor with one finger and tap the expression with another.  The cursor will move to the location of the tap, allowing you to modify the expression at that location.";
